A website for Magic the Gathering common cards which is targeted mainly for pauper cube. 
Allows you to search for common cards and put them in "Borderline", "Cubable" and "Staple" categories.
These categories give you an idea how good an invidual card would be. 

Search for a card by name or choose a card.
Then put card in one of the categories by pressing "B", "C" or "S" button on the site 
and it is put in the chosen category which can be viewed individually.
Searching for cards is pretty flexible, you don't have to type the exact card name,
you can just type some of the words or letters. Search works similarly to Scryfall's own search.
